# Bouncer

Bouncer is a partial, opiniated and [blazing fast](http://samleb.github.io/bouncer/speed/) implementation of [CSS3 Selectors](http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors) in JavaScript.

Its main purpose is to help building better web applications by maximizing the use of event-delegation, while interfacing with your JavaScript library of choice.
